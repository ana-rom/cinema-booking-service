#### Simple RESTful web application</br> will help you manage a small cinema platform:

- a client-server architecture model
- a layered system: 
  - handling HTTP requests in controllers
  - filtering 
  - processing logic and creating services
  - retrieving information from DB
  - responding with JSON objects
- adherence to SOLID principles

### System features

The cinema system involves **2 main parties**: business and customers.</br> 
Both of them have access to the system but different roles to play:</br>
üî∏ business representatives have **ADMIN rights** </br>
üî∏ customers as registered users have **USER rights** or can just be visitors (not registered)


| Admins                                     | Users                                               |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| manage and update  the platform            | give their details to be registered on the platform |
| add different movies and cinema halls      | go through authentication process                   |
| schedule, update and delete movie sessions | check movies and available movie sessions           |
| have access to the number registered users | book tickets via personal shopping cart             |
|                                            | complete the order and check their order history    |

### Configuration

‚û°Ô∏èÔ∏è Clone the project from GitHub </br>
‚û°Ô∏èÔ∏è Configure connection to DB in [db.properties](src/main/resources/db.properties) file in _resources directory_ </br>

        db.driver=YOUR_DATABASE_DRIVER
        db.url=YOUR_DATABASE_URL
        db.user=YOUR_DATABASE_USERNAME
        db.password=YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD

‚û°Ô∏èÔ∏è You can add your personalized admin with login and password in [DataInitializer class](src/main/java/cinema/config/DataInitializer.java) in _cinema.config package_ or use test admin credentials: </br>
