#### Simple RESTful web application</br> will help you manage a small cinema platform:

- a client-server architecture model
- a layered system: 
  - handling HTTP requests in controllers
  - filtering 
  - processing logic and creating services
  - retrieving information from DB
  - responding with JSON objects
- adherence to SOLID principles

### System features

The cinema system involves **2 main parties**: business and customers.</br> 
Both of them have access to the system but different roles to play:</br>
üî∏ business representatives have **ADMIN rights** </br>
üî∏ customers as registered users have **USER rights** or can just be visitors (not registered)


| Admins                                     | Users                                               |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|

| schedule, update and delete movie sessions | check movies and available movie sessions           |
| have access to the number registered users | book tickets via personal shopping cart             |
